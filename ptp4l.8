.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ptp4l
is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) according to IEEE
standard 1588 for Linux. It implements Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock
(OC).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Select the delay mechanism automatically. Start with E2E and switch to P2P when
a peer delay request is received.
.TP
.B \-E
Select the delay request-response (E2E) mechanism. This is the default
mechanism. All clocks on single PTP communication path must use the same
mechanism. A warning will be printed when a peer delay request is received on
port using the E2E mechanism.
.TP
.B \-P
Select the peer delay (P2P) mechanism. A warning will be printed when a delay
request is received on port using the P2P mechanism.
.TP

.B \-4
Select the UDP IPv4 network transport. This is the default transport.
.TP
.B \-6
Select the UDP IPv6 network transport.
.TP
.B \-H
Select the hardware time stamping. All ports specified by the
.B \-i
option and in the configuration file must be attached to the same PTP hardware
clock (PHC). This is the default time stamping.
.TP
.B \-S
Select the software time stamping.
.TP
.B \-L
Select the legacy hardware time stamping.
.TP
.BI \-f " config"
Read configuration from the specified file. No configuration file is read by
default.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration file is divided into sections. Each section starts with a
line containing its name enclosed in brackets and it follows with settings.
Each setting is placed on a separate line, it contains the name of the
option and the value separated by whitespace characters. Empty lines and lines
starting with # are ignored.

The global section (indicated as
.BR [global] )
sets the program options, clock options and default port options. Other
sections are port specific sections and they override the default port options.
The name of the section is the name of the configured port (e.g.
.BR [eth0] ).
Ports specified in the configuration file don't need to be
specified by the
.B \-i
option. An empty port section can be used to replace the command line option.

.SH PORT OPTIONS

.TP
.B delayAsymmetry
The time difference in nanoseconds of the transmit and receive
paths. This value should be positive when the master-to-slave
propagation time is longer and negative when the slave-to-master time
is longer. The default is 0 nanoseconds.
.TP
.B logAnnounceInterval
The mean time interval between Announce messages. A shorter interval makes
ptp4l react faster to the changes in the master-slave hierarchy. The interval
should be the same in the whole domain. It's specified as a power of two in
seconds.
The default is 1 (2 seconds).
.TP
.B logSyncInterval
The mean time interval between Sync messages. A shorter interval may improve
accuracy of the local clock. It's specified as a power of two in seconds.
The default is 0 (1 second).
.TP
.B logMinDelayReqInterval
The minimum permitted mean time interval between Delay_Req messages. A shorter
interval makes ptp4l react faster to the changes in the path delay. It's
specified as a power of two in seconds.
The default is 0 (1 second).
.TP
.B logMinPdelayReqInterval
The minimum permitted mean time interval between Pdelay_Req messages. It's
specified as a power of two in seconds.
The default is 0 (1 second).
.TP
.B announceReceiptTimeout
The number of missed Announce messages before the last Announce messages
expires.
The default is 3.
.TP
.B syncReceiptTimeout
The number of sync/follow up messages that may go missing before
triggering a Best Master Clock election. This option is used for
running in gPTP mode according to the 802.1AS-2011 standard. Setting
this option to zero will disable the sync message timeout.
The default is 0 or disabled.
.TP
.B transportSpecific
The transport specific field. Must be in the range 0 to 255.
The default is 0.
.TP
.B path_trace_enabled

.TP
.B follow_up_info
Include the 802.1AS data in the Follow_Up messages if enabled.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B fault_reset_interval
The time in seconds between the detection of a port's fault and the fault
being reset. This value is expressed as a power of two. Setting this
value to -128 or to the special key word "ASAP" will let the fault be
reset immediately.
The default is 4 (16 seconds).
.TP
.B fault_badpeernet_interval
The time in seconds between the detection of a peer network misconfiguration
and the fault being reset. The port is disabled for the duration of the
interval. The value is in seconds and the special key word ASAP will let
the fault be reset immediately.
The default is 16 seconds.
.TP
.B delay_mechanism
Select the delay mechanism. Possible values are E2E, P2P and Auto.
The default is E2E.
.TP
.B network_transport
Select the network transport. Possible values are UDPv4, UDPv6 and L2.
The default is UDPv4.
.TP

.B clockClass
The clockClass attribute of the local clock. It denotes the traceability of the
time distributed by the grandmaster clock.
The default is 248.
.TP
.B clockAccuracy
The clockAccuracy attribute of the local clock. It is used in the best master
selection algorithm.
The default is 0xFE.

.TP
.B tx_timestamp_timeout
The number of milliseconds to poll waiting for the tx time stamp from the kernel
when a message has recently been sent.
The default is 1.
.TP
.B check_fup_sync
Because of packet reordering that can occur in the network, in the
hardware, or in the networking stack, a follow up message can appear
to arrive in the application before the matching sync message. As this
is a normal occurrence, and the sequenceID message field ensures
proper matching, the ptp4l program accepts out of order packets. This
option adds an additional check using the software time stamps from
the networking stack to verify that the sync message did arrive
first. This option is only useful if you do not trust the sequence IDs
generated by the master.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B clock_servo
The servo which is used to synchronize the local clock. Currently only one
servo is implemented, a PI controller.
The default is pi.

.TP
.B pi_max_frequency
The maximum allowed frequency adjustment of the clock in parts per billion
(ppb). This is an additional limit to the maximum allowed by the hardware. When
set to 0, the hardware limit will be used.
The default is 900000000 (90%).
.TP
.B sanity_freq_limit
The maximum allowed frequency offset between uncorrected clock and the system
monotonic clock in parts per billion (ppb). This is used as a sanity check of
the synchronized clock. When a larger offset is measured, a warning message
will be printed and the servo will be reset. When set to 0, the sanity check is
disabled. The default is 200000000 (20%).

.TP
.B summary_interval
The time interval in which are printed summary statistics of the clock. It is
specified as a power of two in seconds. The statistics include offset root mean
square (RMS), maximum absolute offset, frequency offset mean and standard
deviation, and path delay mean and standard deviation. The units are
nanoseconds and parts per billion (ppb). If there is only one clock update in
the interval, the sample will be printed instead of the statistics. The
messages are printed at the LOG_INFO level.
The default is 0 (1 second).
.TP
.B time_stamping
The time stamping method. The allowed values are hardware, software and legacy.

.B manufacturerIdentity
The manufacturer id which should be an OUI owned by the manufacturer.
The default is 00:00:00.
.TP
.B kernel_leap
When a leap second is announced, let the kernel apply it by stepping the clock
instead of correcting the one-second offset with servo, which would correct the
one-second offset slowly by changing the clock frequency (unless the
.B pi_offset_const
option is set to correct such offset by stepping).
Relevant only with software time stamping. The default is 1 (enabled).
.TP
.B timeSource
The time source is a single byte code that gives an idea of the kind
of local clock in use. The value is purely informational, having no
effect on the outcome of the Best Master Clock algorithm, and is
advertised when the clock becomes grand master.

.SH TIME SCALE USAGE

.B ptp4l
as domain master either uses PTP or UTC time scale depending on time stamping
mode.  In software and legacy time stamping modes it announces Arbitrary time
scale mode, which is effectively UTC here, in hardware time stamping mode it
announces use of PTP time scale.

When
.B ptp4l
is the domain master using hardware time stamping, it is up to
.B phc2sys
to maintain the correct offset between UTC and PTP times. See
.BR phc2sys (8)
manual page for more details.
