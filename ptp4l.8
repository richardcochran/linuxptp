.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ptp4l
is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) according to IEEE
standard 1588 for Linux. It implements Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock
(OC).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Select the delay mechanism automatically. Start with E2E and switch to P2P when
a peer delay request is received.
.TP
.B \-E
Select the delay request-response (E2E) mechanism. This is the default
mechanism. All clocks on single PTP communication path must use the same
mechanism. A warning will be printed when a peer delay request is received on
port using the E2E mechanism.
.TP
.B \-P
Select the peer delay (P2P) mechanism. A warning will be printed when a delay
request is received on port using the P2P mechanism.
.TP
.B \-2
Select the IEEE 802.3 network transport.
.TP
.B \-4
Select the UDP IPv4 network transport. This is the default transport.
.TP
.B \-6
Select the UDP IPv6 network transport.
.TP
.B \-H
Select the hardware time stamping. All ports specified by the
.B \-i
option and in the configuration file must be attached to the same PTP hardware
clock (PHC). This is the default time stamping.
.TP
.B \-S
Select the software time stamping.
.TP
.B \-L
Select the legacy hardware time stamping.
.TP
.BI \-f " config"
Read configuration from the specified file. No configuration file is read by
default.
.TP
.BI \-i " interface"
Specify a PTP port, it may be used multiple times. At least one port must be
specified by this option or in the configuration file.
.TP
.BI \-p " phc-device"
(This option is deprecated.)
Before Linux kernel v3.5 there was no way to discover the PHC device
associated with a network interface.  This option specifies the PHC
device (e.g. /dev/ptp0) to be used when running on legacy kernels.
.TP
.B \-s
Enable the slaveOnly mode.
.TP
.BI \-l " print-level"
Set the maximum syslog level of messages which should be printed or sent to
the system logger. The default is 6 (LOG_INFO).
.TP
.B \-m
Print messages to the standard output.
.TP
.B \-q
Don't send messages to the system logger.
.TP
.B \-v
Prints the software version and exits.
.TP
.BI \-h
Display a help message.

.SH LONG OPTIONS

Each and every configuration file option (see below) may also appear
as a "long" style command line argument.  For example, the slaveOnly
option may be set using either of these two forms.

.RS
\f(CW\-\-slaveOnly 1   \-\-slaveOnly=1\fP
.RE

Option values given on the command line override values in the global
section of the configuration file.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration file is divided into sections. Each section starts with a
line containing its name enclosed in brackets and it follows with settings.
Each setting is placed on a separate line, it contains the name of the
option and the value separated by whitespace characters. Empty lines and lines
starting with # are ignored.

The global section (indicated as
.BR [global] )
sets the program options, clock options and default port options. Other
sections are port specific sections and they override the default port options.
The name of the section is the name of the configured port (e.g.
.BR [eth0] ).
Ports specified in the configuration file don't need to be
specified by the
.B \-i
option. An empty port section can be used to replace the command line option.

.SH PORT OPTIONS

.TP
.B delayAsymmetry
The time difference in nanoseconds of the transmit and receive
paths. This value should be positive when the master-to-slave
propagation time is longer and negative when the slave-to-master time
is longer. The default is 0 nanoseconds.
.TP
.B logAnnounceInterval
The mean time interval between Announce messages. A shorter interval makes
ptp4l react faster to the changes in the master-slave hierarchy. The interval
should be the same in the whole domain. It's specified as a power of two in
seconds.
The default is 1 (2 seconds).
.TP
.B logSyncInterval
The mean time interval between Sync messages. A shorter interval may improve
accuracy of the local clock. It's specified as a power of two in seconds.
The default is 0 (1 second).
.TP
.B logMinDelayReqInterval
The minimum permitted mean time interval between Delay_Req messages. A shorter
interval makes ptp4l react faster to the changes in the path delay. It's
specified as a power of two in seconds.
The default is 0 (1 second).
.TP
.B logMinPdelayReqInterval
The minimum permitted mean time interval between Pdelay_Req messages. It's
specified as a power of two in seconds.
The default is 0 (1 second).
.TP
.B announceReceiptTimeout
The number of missed Announce messages before the last Announce messages
expires.
The default is 3.
.TP
.B syncReceiptTimeout
The number of sync/follow up messages that may go missing before
triggering a Best Master Clock election. This option is used for
running in gPTP mode according to the 802.1AS-2011 standard. Setting
this option to zero will disable the sync message timeout.
The default is 0 or disabled.
.TP
.B transportSpecific
The transport specific field. Must be in the range 0 to 255.
The default is 0.
.TP
.B ignore_transport_specific
By default, incoming messages are dropped if their transportSpecific
field does not match the configured value.  However, many of
transports specified in the 1588 standard mandate ignoring this field.
Moreover, some equipment is known to set the reserved bits.
Configuring this option as 1 causes this field to be ignored
completely on receive.  The default is 0.
.TP
.B path_trace_enabled
Enable the mechanism used to trace the route of the Announce messages.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B follow_up_info
Include the 802.1AS data in the Follow_Up messages if enabled.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B fault_reset_interval
The time in seconds between the detection of a port's fault and the fault
being reset. This value is expressed as a power of two. Setting this
value to \-128 or to the special key word "ASAP" will let the fault be
reset immediately.
The default is 4 (16 seconds).
.TP
.B fault_badpeernet_interval
The time in seconds between the detection of a peer network misconfiguration
and the fault being reset. The port is disabled for the duration of the
interval. The value is in seconds and the special key word ASAP will let
the fault be reset immediately.
The default is 16 seconds.
.TP
.B delay_mechanism
Select the delay mechanism. Possible values are E2E, P2P and Auto.
The default is E2E.
.TP
.B hybrid_e2e
Enables the "hybrid" delay mechanism from the draft Enterprise
Profile. When enabled, ports in the slave state send their delay
request messages to the unicast address taken from the master's
announce message. Ports in the master state will reply to unicast
delay requests using unicast delay responses. This option has no
effect if the delay_mechanism is set to P2P.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B net_sync_monitor
Enables the NetSync Monitor (NSM) protocol. The NSM protocol allows a
station to measure how well another node is synchronized. The monitor
sends a unicast delay request to the node, which replies
unconditionally with unicast delay response, sync, and follow up
messages. If the monitor is synchronized to the GM, it can use the
time stamps in the message to estimate the node's offset.  This option
requires that the 'hybrid_e2e' option be enabled as well.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B performance_monitoring
Enables Performance monitoring (PM). The purpose of monitoring is to
visulize how the PTP timestamps change over time in the network. The
monitoring will be made in 15 minutes and 24 hour cycles. Statistics
for the last completed and the current 24 hour cycle will be stored in
a recordlist along with the statistics for the last 96 15 minutes
cycles.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B ptp_dst_mac
The MAC address to which PTP messages should be sent.
Relevant only with L2 transport. The default is 01:1B:19:00:00:00.
.TP
.B p2p_dst_mac
The MAC address to which peer delay messages should be sent.
Relevant only with L2 transport. The default is 01:80:C2:00:00:0E.
.TP
.B network_transport
Select the network transport. Possible values are UDPv4, UDPv6 and L2.
The default is UDPv4.
.TP
.B neighborPropDelayThresh
Upper limit for peer delay in nanoseconds. If the estimated peer delay is
greater than this value the port is marked as not 802.1AS capable.
.TP
.B min_neighbor_prop_delay
Lower limit for peer delay in nanoseconds. If the estimated peer delay is
smaller than this value the port is marked as not 802.1AS capable.
.TP
.B tsproc_mode
Select the time stamp processing mode used to calculate offset and delay.
Possible values are filter, raw, filter_weight, raw_weight. Raw modes perform
well when the rate of sync messages (logSyncInterval) is similar to the rate of
delay messages (logMinDelayReqInterval or logMinPdelayReqInterval). Weighting
is useful with larger network jitters (e.g. software time stamping).
The default is filter.
.TP
.B delay_filter
Select the algorithm used to filter the measured delay and peer delay. Possible
values are moving_average and moving_median.
The default is moving_median.
.TP
.B delay_filter_length
The length of the delay filter in samples.
The default is 10.
.TP
.B egressLatency
Specifies the difference in nanoseconds between the actual transmission
time at the reference plane and the reported transmit time stamp. This
value will be added to egress time stamps obtained from the hardware.
The default is 0.
.TP
.B ingressLatency
Specifies the difference in nanoseconds between the reported receive
time stamp and the actual reception time at reference plane. This value
will be subtracted from ingress time stamps obtained from the hardware.
The default is 0.
.TP
.B boundary_clock_jbod
When running as a boundary clock (that is, when more than one network
interface is configured), ptp4l performs a sanity check to make sure
that all of the ports share the same hardware clock device. This
option allows ptp4l to work as a boundary clock using "just a bunch of
devices" that are not synchronized to each other. For this mode, the
collection of clocks must be synchronized by an external program, for
example phc2sys(8) in "automatic" mode.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B udp_ttl
Specifies the Time to live (TTL) value for IPv4 multicast messages and the hop
limit for IPv6 multicast messages. This option is only relevant with the IPv4
and IPv6 UDP transports. The default is 1 to restrict the messages sent by
.B ptp4l
to the same subnet.

.SH PROGRAM AND CLOCK OPTIONS

.TP
.B twoStepFlag
Enable two-step mode for sync messages. One-step mode can be used only with
hardware time stamping.
The default is 1 (enabled).
.TP
.B slaveOnly
The local clock is a slave-only clock if enabled.
This option is only for use with 1588 clocks and should not be enabled
for 802.1AS clocks.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B gmCapable
If this option is enabled, then the local clock is able to become grand master.
This is only for use with 802.1AS clocks and has no effect on 1588 clocks.
The default is 1 (enabled).
.TP
.B priority1

selection algorithm, lower values take precedence. Must be in the range 0 to
255.
The default is 128.
.TP
.B priority2
The priority2 attribute of the local clock. It is used in the best master
selection algorithm, lower values take precedence. Must be in the range 0 to
255.
The default is 128.

.B clockClass
The clockClass attribute of the local clock. It denotes the traceability of the
time distributed by the grandmaster clock.
The default is 248.
.TP
.B clockAccuracy
The clockAccuracy attribute of the local clock. It is used in the best master
selection algorithm.
The default is 0xFE.

The offsetScaledLogVariance attribute of the local clock. It characterizes the
stability of the clock.
The default is 0xFFFF.
.TP

.TP
.B assume_two_step
Treat one-step responses as two-step if enabled. It is used to work around
buggy 802.1AS switches.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B tx_timestamp_timeout
The number of milliseconds to poll waiting for the tx time stamp from the kernel
when a message has recently been sent.
The default is 1.
.TP
.B check_fup_sync
Because of packet reordering that can occur in the network, in the
hardware, or in the networking stack, a follow up message can appear
to arrive in the application before the matching sync message. As this
is a normal occurrence, and the sequenceID message field ensures
proper matching, the ptp4l program accepts out of order packets. This
option adds an additional check using the software time stamps from
the networking stack to verify that the sync message did arrive
first. This option is only useful if you do not trust the sequence IDs
generated by the master.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B clock_servo
The servo which is used to synchronize the local clock. Valid values
are "pi" for a PI controller, "linreg" for an adaptive controller
using linear regression, "ntpshm" for the NTP SHM reference clock to
allow another process to synchronize the local clock (the SHM segment
number is set to the domain number), and "nullf" for a servo that
always dials frequency offset zero (for use in SyncE nodes).
The default is "pi."
.TP

The proportional constant of the PI controller. When set to 0.0, the
proportional constant will be set by the following formula from the current
sync interval.
The default is 0.0.

the PI controller from the sync interval.
The default is 0.3.
.TP
.B step_threshold
The maximum offset the servo will correct by changing the clock
frequency instead of stepping the clock. When set to 0.0, the servo will
never step the clock except on start. It's specified in seconds.
The default is 0.0.
This option used to be called
.BR pi_offset_const .
.TP
.B first_step_threshold
The maximum offset the servo will correct by changing the clock
frequency instead of stepping the clock. This is only applied on the first
update. It's specified in seconds. When set to 0.0, the servo won't step
the clock on start.
The default is 0.00002 (20 microseconds).
This option used to be called
.BR pi_f_offset_const .
.TP
.B max_frequency
The maximum allowed frequency adjustment of the clock in parts per billion
(ppb). This is an additional limit to the maximum allowed by the hardware. When
set to 0, the hardware limit will be used.

This option used to be called
.BR pi_max_frequency .
.TP
.B sanity_freq_limit
The maximum allowed frequency offset between uncorrected clock and the system

will be printed and the servo will be reset. When set to 0, the sanity check is
disabled. The default is 200000000 (20%).
.TP
.B initial_delay
The initial path delay of the clock in nanoseconds used for synchronization of

event messages. Must be a value between 0 and 63. There are several media
streaming standards out there that require specific values for this option.
For example 46 (EF PHB) in AES67 or 48 (CS6 PHB) in RAVENNA. The default
is 0.
.TP
.B dscp_general
Defines the Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) to be used for PTP
general messages. Must be a value between 0 and 63. There are several media

is 0.
.TP
.B logging_level
The maximum logging level of messages which should be printed.
The default is 6 (LOG_INFO).
.TP
.B message_tag
The tag which is added to all messages printed to the standard output or system
log.

.B verbose
Print messages to the standard output if enabled.
The default is 0 (disabled).
.TP
.B use_syslog
Print messages to the system log if enabled.
The default is 1 (enabled).

specified as a power of two in seconds. The statistics include offset root mean
square (RMS), maximum absolute offset, frequency offset mean and standard
deviation, and path delay mean and standard deviation. The units are
nanoseconds and parts per billion (ppb). If there is only one clock update in
the interval, the sample will be printed instead of the statistics. The
messages are printed at the LOG_INFO level.
The default is 0 (1 second).
.TP
.B time_stamping
The time stamping method. The allowed values are hardware, software and legacy.
The default is hardware.
.TP
.B productDescription

manufacturerName;modelNumber;instanceIdentifier and contain at most 64
utf8 symbols. The default is ";;".
.TP
.B revisionData

.TP
.B manufacturerIdentity
The manufacturer id which should be an OUI owned by the manufacturer.
The default is 00:00:00.
.TP
.B kernel_leap
When a leap second is announced, let the kernel apply it by stepping the clock
instead of correcting the one-second offset with servo, which would correct the
one-second offset slowly by changing the clock frequency (unless the
.B step_threshold
option is set to correct such offset by stepping).
Relevant only with software time stamping. The default is 1 (enabled).
.TP
.B timeSource
The time source is a single byte code that gives an idea of the kind
of local clock in use. The value is purely informational, having no
effect on the outcome of the Best Master Clock algorithm, and is
advertised when the clock becomes grand master.

.SH TIME SCALE USAGE

.B ptp4l
as domain master either uses PTP or UTC time scale depending on time stamping
mode.  In software and legacy time stamping modes it announces Arbitrary time
scale mode, which is effectively UTC here, in hardware time stamping mode it
announces use of PTP time scale.

When
.B ptp4l
is the domain master using hardware time stamping, it is up to
.B phc2sys
to maintain the correct offset between UTC and PTP times. See
.BR phc2sys (8)
manual page for more details.
