# key lines should be in the format: id type length value
# - id:     Must be in the range of 1 to 2^32-1, inclusive.
# - type:   Allowed are SHA256-128, SHA256, AES128, AES256.
# - length: Optional verification key length in octets. Used to
#           verify the key value is of the length specified.
# - value:  Can be read as ASCII characters with the "ASCII:" prefix,
#           as a hexadecimal number with the "HEX:" prefix or as a
#           Base64 encoded string with the "B64:" prefix. If no
#           prefix is included, ASCII is assumed. Key values should
#           be randomally generated if possible. Ciphers (AES)
#           require the key length to match the cipher length
#           (ie AES-128 requires key of 128 bits or 16 bytes).
